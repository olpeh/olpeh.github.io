## Long Time No Blog Posts

Hey! Just wanted to give an update on what's going on and why this blog has not received any new posts in almost a year!

In the spring this year, I started writing a new blog post and realized the my current blog, built with Jekyll, [does not work locally anymore](https://twitter.com/0lpeh/status/1231528880739102720){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

## New Blog Coming Up

Rewriting your blog platform every year is something every developer needs to do, right?

You can see from the above linked Twitter thread, or guess what was inevitable – a full blown rewrite of my personal blog, of course!

Stay tuned, the new blog is coming soon™ and I promise to be more actively writing and publishing blog posts in the future.
